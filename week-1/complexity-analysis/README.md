# Complexity Analysis

**Complexity analysis** is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves assessing the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their resource usage, such as time and space. It helps in understanding how an algorithm's performance scales with increasing input size.

There are two primary aspects of complexity analysis:

1. **Time Complexity:** This measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of its input. Time complexity is often expressed using **Big O notation**, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time. Common time complexities include `O(1)` (**constant time**), `O(log n)` (**logarithmic time**), `O(n)` (**linear time**), `O(n log n)` (**linearithmic time**), `O(n^2)` (**quadratic time**), `O(2^n)` (**exponential time**), etc.

2. **Space Complexity:** This measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of its input. Space complexity is also expressed using **Big O notation**. It describes the maximum amount of memory required by the algorithm at any point during its execution, not necessarily the total memory used. Common space complexities include `O(1)` (**constant space**), `O(n)` (**linear space**), `O(n^2)` (**quadratic space**), etc.
