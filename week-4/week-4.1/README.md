### What is Binary Search
- **Binary search** is a **searching algorithm**, that works on a **monotonic sequence (increasing or decreasing)** and efficiently searches for an element. 
- **Binary search** is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a **sorted list of items**. It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half until the item is found, or it is clear that the item is not in the list.
